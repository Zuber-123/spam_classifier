# 📩 SMS Spam Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 🧠 Overview

This classifier uses text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and machine learning models to detect spam messages with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

- Text Cleaning & Preprocessing
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Model Training (Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.)
- Web App with Streamlit
- Real-time spam detection

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Streamlit
- Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset
SMS Spam Collection Dataset

📌 Future Work
Add LSTM/Transformer-based models

Deploy on cloud (Heroku, Render)

Add phone number/email validation
